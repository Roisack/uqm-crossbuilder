# by lb_build.

# envvar HOST_TRIPLET

# This is used as the host triplet for the cross toolchain.
# Autoconf-using packages will get this in their --host option,
# and packages will be installed to /usr/$HOST_TRIPLET.
# Do not change unless you have changed the cross toolchain to be used
# in base-cross-toolchain.list.

# Specifies the URL of the libiconv source tarball you want to use.
# Change this if you want to use a different version, or a different
# GNU mirror.
