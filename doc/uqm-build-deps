Most of the build-time 'magic' that sets the cross-toolchain up for compiling UQM happens
in a set of shell scripts, called from a chroot-stage hook (that is, the hook is called by
lb build while setting up the chroot). The hook (config/hooks/build-uqm-dependencies.chroot)
acts merely as a wrapper, specifying envvars for the crossbuild_foo scripts which reside in
'config/includes.chroot/usr/src/crossbuild'. If for some reason you need to modify the build
process, please read build-uqm-dependencies.chroot, and one of the crossbuild_foo scripts.
